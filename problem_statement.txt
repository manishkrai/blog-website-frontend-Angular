create the database tables using flyway and input the test data to the database using flyway.

we need the following endpoint: create upcoming match

								get all the winner team name (when away_team_score > then home_team or home_team_score > away_team_score it is a winner)
								get all the team names and team id-s
								get all upcoming matches by team id
								get all matches by team id
								update start date of match
								update team name
								
create the project in your github repository and share it with gk@20shots.co.uk
